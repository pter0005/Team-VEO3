## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid orange (#FF8C00) to capture attention and represent energy and innovation, inspired by the mention of orange in the original prompt.
- Background color: Dark gray (#222222), a desaturated near-black providing contrast in the dark scheme.
- Accent color: Yellow-orange (#D4A62A) used for interactive elements and highlights, contrasting well with both the primary and background.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif.
- Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif, a font well-suited for medium-length paragraphs.
- Tech-themed icons that reflect Google Veo 3’s features. The user requests “circular or geometric” icons and a "tech" style, so we will make use of futuristic-looking designs.
- Subtle hover animations for buttons and menu items.
